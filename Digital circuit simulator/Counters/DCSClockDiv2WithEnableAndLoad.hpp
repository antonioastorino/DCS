 This clock divider is mainly meant to be used as a building block for counters
 The minimum clock period is 10 (5 high + 5 low) tau.
 
 Inputs 0 (Data) and 1 (Load) must be stable for at least 4 tau before and 1 tau before the clock rising edge. The resulting output is displayed 5 time after the rising edge.
 Inputs 3 (Clear) and 4 (Preset) are directly connected to the internal JK master-slave. They must be stable for at least 3 tau and their effect is visible 3 tau after they are set.
 Input 5 (Count in) asserts both J and K in the internal latch with a delay of 2 tau. Therefore, it has to remain stable from 3 tau to 1 tau before the clock rising edge while Load is low.
 
 Output 2 (Count out) is high when input 5 and out 0 are high, with a delay of 1 tau. When connecting several dividers in cascade, this delay is multiplied by the number of dividers. This has to be taken into account when chosing the clock speed. When counting
