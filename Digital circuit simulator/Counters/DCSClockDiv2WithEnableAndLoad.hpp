 This clock divider is mainly meant to be used as a building block for counters
 The minimum clock period is 10 (5 high + 5 low) tau.
 Reset and clear must be stable for at least 3 tau. Their effect is visible 3 tau after they are set.
 Inputs 0 (Data) and 1 (Load) must become stable not later than 3 tau before the clock rising edge and they have to remain stable for at least 2 tau after the that same time.
 Inputs 3 (Clear) and 4 (Preset) are directly connected to the internal JK master-slave.
 Input 5 (Count in) must be stable from not later 2 tau from the clock rising edge and stay stable from at least 2 tau after this clock transition.
 
 Output 2 (Count out) is high when input 5 and out 0 are high, with a delay of 1 tau. When connecting several dividers in cascade, this delay is multiplied by the number of dividers. This has to be taken into account when chosing the clock speed.
